# The Spy Life 
## Objective
 
You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher. 
 

## Task:  

Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message. 
 

## Input Format:   

A string of characters that represent the encoded message. 
 

## Output Format:  

A string of character that represent the intended secret message. 
 

## Sample Input:  

```
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H 
```
 

## Sample Output:  

```
Hello World 
```


## Explanation:  

If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original message and flip it around, you get 'Hello World'.


## Solution

```python

letter_space = '''
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwqyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWQYZ
'''

english = ''
for word in str(input()):
    if word in letter_space:
        english += word
    
print(english[::-1])

```
