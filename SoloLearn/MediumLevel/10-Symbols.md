# Symbols 
## Objective
 
There is a problem with your keyboard: it randomly writes symbols when you are typing a text. You need to clean up the text by removing all symbols. 
 

## Task:  

Take a text that includes some random symbols and translate it into a text that has none of them. The resulting text should only include letters and numbers. 
 

## Input Format:  

A string with random symbols. 
 

## Output Format:  

A string of the text with all the symbols removed. 
 

## Sample Input:  

```
#l$e%ts go @an#d@@ g***et #l#unch$$$ 
```
 

## Sample Output:  

```
lets go and get lunch 
```


## Explanation:  

If you take out every symbol and leave only the letters and numbers, your text says 'lets go and get lunch'.


## Solution

```python

import re

print(''.join(re.findall(r'[A-Za-z\d\s]+', input())))

```
