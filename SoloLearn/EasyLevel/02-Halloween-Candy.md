# Halloween Candy 
## Objective

You go trick or treating with a friend and all but three of the houses that you visit are giving out candy. One house that you visit is giving out toothbrushes and two houses are giving out dollar bills.  
 

## Task 

Given the input of the total number of houses that you visited, what is the percentage chance that one random item pulled from your bag is a dollar bill?  


## Input Format  

An integer (>=3) representing the total number of houses that you visited.  


## Output Format 

A percentage value rounded up to the nearest whole number. 


## Sample Input 

```
4 
```


## Sample Output  

```
50 
```


### Explanation  

If you visited four houses, one would be candy, two would be dollars, and one would be a toothbrush. A 2 in 4 chance is 50%.


## Solution

```python

houses = int(input())

import math
value = 2 * 100 / houses
print(math.ceil(value))

```
